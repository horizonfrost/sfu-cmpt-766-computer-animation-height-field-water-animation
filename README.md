## Unity Setup

- To begin, open the github project: [Github Link] (https://github.com/horizonfrost/sfu-cmpt-766-computer-animation-height-field-water-animation)
- Click 'Code' > 'Download zip' > extract sfu-cmpt-766-computer-animation-height-field-water-animation-main.zip
- Open the extracted folder sfu-cmpt-766-computer-animation-height-field-water-animation-main as a Unity project in Unity Hub
- select 2022.3.62f2 as the editor version
- Once the project is opened, open the scene in Assets → Scenes → 'Water sim' to begin the demo.

## Run the Code
- After opening the 'Water sim' scene, press the 'Play' button
- You will see a pool of water with three balls in it
- The water surface should animate with floating balls interacting with waves.
- Now you can perform any of the below steps:
    - grab any ball and drop it from a height and you will see water ripples
    - every ball has a different density: the green ball will float but the gray ball will get submerged in the water completely. The medium density white ball will get submerged 3/4th and while the 1/4th top is above the water
    - you can also move the balls horizontally to see waves being generated
    - If you drag the green ball towards the bottom of the pool and then leave it, it will bounce back and come to the surface automatically
