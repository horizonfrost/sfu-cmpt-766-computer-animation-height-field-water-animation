## Unity Setup

- To begin, open the github project: [Github Link](https://github.com/horizonfrost/sfu-cmpt-766-computer-animation-height-field-water-animation)
- Click 'Code' > 'Download zip' > extract sfu-cmpt-766-computer-animation-height-field-water-animation-main.zip
- Open the extracted folder sfu-cmpt-766-computer-animation-height-field-water-animation-main as a Unity project in Unity Hub
- select 2022.3.62f2 as the editor version
- Once the project is opened, open the scene in Assets → Scenes → 'Water sim' to begin the demo.

## Run the Code
- Open the `Water sim` scene in Unity and press the Play button.
- You will see a pool of water with three balls floating in it. The water surface animates interactively with the balls.

### Interactions:
- Grab any ball using mouse and drop it from a height to generate ripples in the water.
- Ball densities vary:
    - Green ball – floats on the surface.
    - White ball – partially submerges (~3/4 submerged).
    - Gray ball – fully submerges.
- Move balls horizontally to see waves propagate.
- Drag the green ball to the bottom and release it – it will bounce back and rise to the surface automatically.
